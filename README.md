LastPark
========

iPhone app to remember location of the parked car.

For cars that have Bluetooth capability (e.g for hands free calling)
this app can be used to remember the last location and time the iPhone
lost Bluetooth connectivity with the car.

This app uses private framework -- BluetoothManager.

This app does not work as intended as it fails to get woken up from suspended state.
